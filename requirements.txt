# DuckScanner Requirements
# This scanner uses only Python standard library modules
# No external dependencies required for basic functionality!

# Standard library modules used:
# - tkinter (GUI framework)
# - socket (network connections)
# - threading (concurrent scanning)
# - subprocess (ping operations)
# - argparse (command line arguments)
# - json (data serialization)
# - csv (CSV export)
# - time (timing operations)
# - datetime (timestamps)
# - concurrent.futures (thread pool management)
# - platform (OS detection)
# - ipaddress (IP network handling)
# - os (file operations)
# - sys (system operations)

# Optional: For enhanced functionality, you could add:
# scapy>=2.4.5              # For advanced packet crafting and SYN scanning
# python-nmap>=0.7.1        # For nmap integration
# colorama>=0.4.4           # For colored terminal output
# psutil>=5.8.0             # For system monitoring
# requests>=2.25.1          # For HTTP banner grabbing
# cryptography>=3.4.8       # For SSL/TLS analysis
# pillow>=8.2.0             # For image processing in reports
# matplotlib>=3.3.4         # For scan result visualization
# pandas>=1.3.0             # For data analysis and reporting

# Development dependencies (optional):
# pytest>=6.2.4            # For testing
# black>=21.5b2             # For code formatting
# flake8>=3.9.2             # For linting
# mypy>=0.910               # For type checking
